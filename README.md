Friend Finder:

To use this friend finder it is very simple. You will start out on the home page where you will only be given the options to add a new friend or view the object that has all of the friends in it or a link to the git hub repository for this project.

- To use the add friend feature you just have to click the blue botton and fill in the information. You will then be added to the list of friends in the link object that shows all of the friends and a module will show which friend of the existing ones has the closest score to yours.

NOTE: I also console logged to the terminal the difference between your score and the person matched as your friend.
